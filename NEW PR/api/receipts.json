Add the onion, fennel and carrots and cook for about 10 mins until the veg start to soften. Pour in the wine and brandy, bubble hard for about 1 min to drive off the alcohol, then add the tomatoes, stock and paprika. Cover and simmer for 30 mins. Meanwhile, chop the prawns.\r\nBlitz the soup as finely as you can with a stick blender or food processor, then press through a sieve into a bowl. Spend a bit of time really working the mixture through the sieve as this will give the soup its velvety texture.\r\nTip back into a clean pan, add the prawns and cook for 10 mins, then blitz again until smooth. You can make and chill this a day ahead or freeze it for 1 month. Thaw ovenight in the fridge. To serve, gently reheat in a pan with the cream. If garnishing, cook the 8 prawns in a little butter. Spoon into small bowls and top with the prawns and snipped fennel fronds.","strMealThumb":"https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/rtwwvv1511799504.jpg","strTags":"Soup,Warm,Seafood,Shellfish","strYoutube":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4thpMbDakgM","strIngredient1":"Tiger Prawns","strIngredient2":"Olive Oil","strIngredient3":"Onion","strIngredient4":"Fennel","strIngredient5":"Carrots","strIngredient6":"Dry White Wine","strIngredient7":"Brandy","strIngredient8":"Chopped Tomatoes","strIngredient9":"Fish Stock","strIngredient10":"Paprika","strIngredient11":"Double Cream","strIngredient12":"Prawns","strIngredient13":"","strIngredient14":"","strIngredient15":"","strIngredient16":"","strIngredient17":"","strIngredient18":"","strIngredient19":"","strIngredient20":"","strMeasure1":"450g","strMeasure2":"4 tbs","strMeasure3":"1 large","strMeasure4":"1 large","strMeasure5":"2 chopped","strMeasure6":"150ml","strMeasure7":"1 tbs","strMeasure8":"400g","strMeasure9":"1L","strMeasure10":"2 pinches","strMeasure11":"150ml","strMeasure12":"8","strMeasure13":"","strMeasure14":"","strMeasure15":"","strMeasure16":"","strMeasure17":"","strMeasure18":"","strMeasure19":"","strMeasure20":"","strSource":"https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/71600/prawn-and-fennel-bisque","dateModified":null},{"idMeal":"52962","strMeal":"Salmon Eggs Eggs Benedict","strDrinkAlternate":null,"strCategory":"Breakfast","strArea":"American","strInstructions":"First make the Hollandaise sauce. Put the lemon juice and vinegar in a small bowl, add the egg yolks and whisk with a balloon whisk until light and frothy. Place the bowl over a pan of simmering water and whisk until mixture thickens. Gradually add the butter, whisking constantly until thick â€“ if it looks like it might be splitting, then whisk off the heat for a few mins. Season and keep warm.\r\n\r\nTo poach the eggs, bring a large pan of water to the boil and add the vinegar. Lower the heat so that the water is simmering gently. Stir the water so you have a slight whirlpool, then slide in the eggs one by one. Cook each for about 4 mins, then remove with a slotted spoon.\r\n\r\nLightly toast and butter the muffins, then put a couple of slices of salmon on each half. Top each with an egg, spoon over some Hollandaise and garnish with chopped chives.","strMealThumb":"https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/1550440197.jpg","strTags":"Bun,Brunch","strYoutube":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Woiiet4vQ58","strIngredient1":"Eggs","strIngredient2":"White Wine Vinegar","strIngredient3":"English Muffins","strIngredient4":"Butter","strIngredient5":"Smoked Salmon","strIngredient6":"Lemon Juice","strIngredient7":"White Wine Vinegar","strIngredient8":"Egg","strIngredient9":"Unsalted Butter","strIngredient10":"","strIngredient11":"","strIngredient12":"","strIngredient13":"","strIngredient14":"","strIngredient15":"","strIngredient16":"","strIngredient17":"","strIngredient18":"","strIngredient19":"","strIngredient20":"","strMeasure1":"4","strMeasure2":"2 tbs","strMeasure3":"2","strMeasure4":"To serve","strMeasure5":"8 slices","strMeasure6":"2 tsp","strMeasure7":"2 tsp","strMeasure8":"3 Yolkes","strMeasure9":"125g","strMeasure10":" ","strMeasure11":" ","strMeasure12":" ","strMeasure13":" ","strMeasure14":" ","strMeasure15":" ","strMeasure16":" ","strMeasure17":" ","strMeasure18":" ","strMeasure19":" ","strMeasure20":" ","strSource":"https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/73606/eggs-benedict-with-smoked-salmon-and-chives","dateModified":null}]
